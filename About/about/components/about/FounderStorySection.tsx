            Rollie was born from a simple idea: creating tech-infused lifestyle products
            that spark joy. Our founder, inspired by the blend of design and innovation,
            set out on a journey to transform everyday essentials into something magical.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-600">
            What started as a small vision quickly grew into a brand driven by creativity,
            innovation, and a passion for quality.
